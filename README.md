# American-Southwest-Climate-Analysis
Anthropogenic climate change is a threat which will define the 21st century. The following analysis explores the changing climate of the American Southwest, considering the US states of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico. 

This analysis picks weather stations near population centers within each state to evaluate the change in temperature, precipitation, and groundwater levels since 2010.

As a data science final project, this report emphasizes API data sourcing, data manipulation, and comparative plotting for trends and distributions.
